title: "Privacy Policy"

This privacy policy documents what data Restyled has access to about its users and what Restyled does with it. This policy covers the use of the https://restyled.io website and the Restyled.io GitHub App.

## Overview

Installing the Restyled.io GitHub App explicitly grants us access to some of the data you've shared with GitHub. This can include personal data, source code repository content, and repository metadata.

We avoid mirroring any of this data on our own systems as much as we can. In order to provide the service that we do, we do need to store the following pieces of data ourselves:

- Repository and organization names
- Pull Request numbers and ids
- Email addresses

At any point, you have the option to:

- Un-install the Restyled.io GitHub App, removing our access
- [Request by email](mailto:support@restyled.io) that we delete any data we currently have

## Hosting Provider

Restyled's infrastructure is hosted on Heroku and Amazon Web Services, therefore these third parties have full access to any data we store, and their own privacy policies will apply.

## Request & Process Logs

Restyled logs requests made to the restyled.io website and information about restyling processes stopping and starting. Request logs include internet protocol (IP) addresses, date and time stamp, and referring/exit pages. Process logs include repository names and pull request numbers.

These logs expire in no more than 30 days, often as quickly as 7.

## Restyle Job Logs

Logs for an individual restyling of a Pull Request are preserved for 30 days. These logs include repository and organization names, pull request numbers, file paths within the repository being restyled, and any messages emitted by the underlying formatter(s).

## Cookies

User sessions on restyled.io are stored in 'cookies'. These cookies are used to store information including authorization state for logged-in users.
