## Stale info

```
To https://github.com/....git
 ! [rejected]              ... -> ... (stale info)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://<SCRUBBED>@github.com/....git'

```

This means that multiple Restyled jobs ran at once, and things changed between the time this Job cloned and the time it finished and attempted this push. Since we use `--force-with-lease`, `git` is refusing to overwrite possibly more correct work (theirs) with possibly less correct (ours).

This is an intermittent race condition, and pushing a new commit to your PR should Restyle correctly. We're exploring options for handling this scenario better, feel free to follow along in https://github.com/restyled-io/restyler/issues/88.

## Refusing to allow a bot...

```
To https://github.com/....git
 ! [remote rejected] ... (refusing to allow a bot to create or update workflow `.github/workflows/...`)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://<SCRUBBED>@github.com/....git'
[Info] Setting status of error for ...
```

GitHub may prevent a bot user (which we are) from pushing a change to anything under `.github/workflows`. This means any Restyle PRs that attempt to change such a file will encounter this error.

To work around this, we have a default global [`exclude`](https://github.com/restyled-io/restyler/blob/5f30eb289a98552be6a39f667052b66f39fb4d16/config/default.yaml#L9) for them. If you are encountering this error and you've changed that setting, please update it to keep the `.github/workflows` element.

### But Restyled didn't change a workflow file

If you're repository is a Fork, the Restyled PR will contain the original change along with the restyling. If
the original change impacted a workflow file, the whole PR will be rejected. Not much can be done to avoid this,
and you will most likely want to merge such PRs without Restyled feedback.

If you really wanted to get Restyled working, you could:

- Locally use [`restyle-path`](https://github.com/restyled-io/restyler/blob/5f30eb289a98552be6a39f667052b66f39fb4d16/bin/restyle-path) and push the results to the original PR. If there are no differences, Restyled will not attempt to open a Restyle PR and so will not error.

- Separate any changes to `.github/workflows` and merge them first (without Restyled's feedback), then open the rest of the changes again. Restyled shouldn't error on that new PR.

### But there's no change to a workflow file at all

Please check if your branch is a bit stale against its the base,

> This branch is 9 commits ahead, **28 commits behind** {org}/{repo}:main.

We believe GitHub's check for this has a bug and if there exists a change to a workflow file
in those 28 commits you are behind the base branch, the push will be rejected -- despite that
change not being visible anywhere in the diff of the PR.

If this is the case, you should rebase your branch.
