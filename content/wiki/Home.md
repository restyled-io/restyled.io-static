Restyled is a [CLI](https://github.com/restyled-io/restyler#readme) and corresponding [GitHub Action](https://github.com/restyled-io/actions#readme) for automatically applying style fixes to a Pull Request. It supports over 56 different [_Restylers_](https://docs.restyled.io/available-restylers/), which are thin wrappers over the auto-formatting tools you may already use today.

> [!NOTE]

## Features

1. Runs on every PR every time, no need for every contributor to setup or configure anything
1. Apply style fixes by merging a sibling PR, copy/pasting a `git am` command, or installing and running our CLI locally
1. Zero-install, zero configuration option -- most Restylers are automatic based on file extensions
1. Plays well with non-Restyler usage -- if you have an in-repository configuration (e.g. `.prettierrc`) it will be respected
