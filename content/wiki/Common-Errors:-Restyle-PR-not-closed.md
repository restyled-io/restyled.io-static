We intend to clean up after ourselves when you close a Pull Request that we've restyled. This includes
closing any Restyle PR left open, if you chose not to merge it. Sometimes (often in fact) this may not
work. This is a known Issue.

See https://github.com/restyled-io/restyler/issues/150 for the details on why.
